The visual presentation of text (sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined, where the sequence is expressing something in human language) and images of text (text that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order to achieve a particular visual effect) has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for Level AA and at least 7:1 for Level AAA, except for the following:

- Large Text
  - Large-scale (with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts) text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for Lavel AA and at least 4.5:1 for Level AAA;
- Incidental
  - Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component (a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function), that are pure decoration (serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality), that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
- Logotypes
  - Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement.
